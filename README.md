## Project Description

The **Vision-Based Guiding and Navigation Robot** is an IoT-enabled intelligent robotic system designed to assist users—particularly elderly and visually impaired individuals—by providing real-time guidance, obstacle avoidance, and interactive navigation support.

The robot leverages **computer vision**, **sensor-based perception**, and **voice interaction** to recognize a specific user, follow them safely, detect obstacles, and respond to voice commands. The system combines hardware and software intelligence to operate autonomously in indoor environments while ensuring user safety and ease of interaction.

This project demonstrates the integration of **AI-powered vision**, **embedded systems**, and **IoT technologies** to build a practical assistive robotic solution.
